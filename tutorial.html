  <p>Maybe you're here because you don't know how to play my Dogecoin Clicker. Maybe not. But here is how to play.</p>
  <p>When you first start the game, it will ask you how much dogecoin you need. If you guess right, you get an reward!<br />
  Once you have guessed, you click on the coin and gain dogecoin. Once you have enough, you can by <i><b>Auto Click</b></i>.<br />
  Once you have auto click, you can get more dogecoin! Keep gaining dogecoin until you have 5,000. Then sell it to get doge gems!<br />
  You should then be on the moon. Don't stop there, you can get to <b>Mars!</b></p>
